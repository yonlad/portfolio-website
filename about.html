            <p>Yonatan Eshban-Laderman is a San Francisco-based interdisciplinary artist working at the intersection of performance, technology, and politics. </p>
                
            
            <p>Yonatan began his practice as a theater director. He was significantly influenced by artists such as Reza Abdoh and the Wooster Group. Seeking for ways to break the traditional space of the stage, Yonatan began to experiment with developing interactive environments that transform viewers into active participants and co-creators of dramatic scenarios. During his time studying at Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), he explored replacing the conventional theatrical script with code-driven systems, creating technologically-mediated experiences that challenge anthropocentric approaches to performance. These days, Yonatan is infatuated with computer vision and the internet.</p>
            

            <p>Yonatan graduated from Stanford University with distinction, earning a B.S. in Symbolic Systems with a practice-based Honors Thesis as well as an M.A. in German Studies with concentrations in performance studies and media studies. </p>
