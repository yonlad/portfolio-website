        <p>In <em>when we are two</em>, an audience member is invited to join me on stage and meet me with their eyes across a dimly lit dinner table. In this intimate yet alienating setting, made possible only through and by technology, we explore the profound yet often uncomfortable act of sustained eye contact between strangers, transforming the gaze into a vehicle of discovery.</p>

            <p><em>when we are two</em> stages an abstract meeting through digital transmutation. Entering an environment directed by a custom-made software, the performers experience each other in a new way: visualize the traces of their gaze, converse without words, connect and find intimacy through technological alienation.</p>
            <p>Using pupil-tracking technology, webcams capture the saccades of the performers' eyes as they look at each other. Custom software transforms these subtle movements into dual real-time visualizations: behind each participant, a live-stream projection displays an evolving line drawing – a portrait drawn by each viewer's gaze.</p>

        <div class="column">
           
            <p>Simultaneously, the eye movements of each participant feed into an orchestra of synthesizers, creating a 4-channel soundscape where each performer's visual input sculpts half of the audio composition. The result is a technological dialogue where two pairs of speakers voice the unspoken conversation between the performers' eyes.</p>

        <p>In the embedded recording there was a technical difficulty which kept erasing the line drawing appearing on the screen behind the volunteer participant, so only the screen behind me drew an image. This was fixed. I am currently expanding this performance to be a 30-40 min show in the hope of touring it.</p>
